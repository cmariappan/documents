<p>Drupal is an open source content management platform supporting a variety of
websites ranging from personal weblogs to large community-driven websites. For
more information, visit the Drupal website, <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal.org</a>, and join
the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/community">Drupal community</a>.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Drupal is developed on <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal.org</a>, the home of the international
Drupal community since 2001!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal.org</a> hosts Drupal's <a href="https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal">GitLab repository</a>,
its <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/drupal">issue queue</a>, and its <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation">documentation</a>. Before
you start working on code, be sure to search the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/drupal">issue queue</a> and
create an issue if your aren't able to find an existing issue.</p>

<p>Every issue on Drupal.org automatically creates a new community-accessible fork
that you can contribute to. Learn more about the code contribution process on
the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/gitlab-integration/issue-forks-merge-requests">Issue forks &amp; merge requests page</a>.</p>
